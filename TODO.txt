# TODO

## Environment

* [X] fullscreen seems currently broken. called inside L5 at wrong time or related to setup events drawing call rewrite?
* [ ] error detection with useful error messages
* [X] fix flickering on event handling - graphics in mousePressed(), keyTyped(), keyReleased() double draw call and cause flickering i think
* [X] debug mouseClicked - probably needs to be added to draw after mousePressed
* [X] move all non-user-editable globals and constants to be keys in a single global env table (to prevent collisions with user-defined variables)
* [X] check transforms reset at correct time? see the rotating square example.
* [ ] only call setup code once
* [ ] make setup() optional so that defaults/constants are set even without a setup (L5_env, size, etc)

## Color

* [X] line should be stroke color
* [X] html color names
* [X] Hex code colors
* [ ] add [HSB](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/HSV_color) and [HSL](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/HSL_color)
  * [X] add ability to set max value per val in table (RGBA, HSLA, HSBA)
* [ ] using html color name should assume RGB mode despite actual global L5_env.color_mode (or other way to handle this since stored as RGB value tables, values max 255)
* [X] colorMode should also allow setting individual max values for RGBA (or HSL/HSB) etc
* [X] fix: noFill seems to turn off all fill going forward, overriding fill()
* [ ] tint didn't seem to work when specified as 2-values: grayness,alpha
* [ ] test / fix ability to switch between filters

## Shapes

* [ ] test and fix arc to be consistent with p5 arc
* [X] ellipseMode doesn't seem to work? 

## Filter

* [ ] Improve blur algorithm
* [ ] review optional params for consistency with processing/p5
* [ ] filter doesn't currently apply to setup, only in draw

## Typography

* [X] font size (via L5_env.currentFontSize) does not seem to carry over from setup() to draw()

## Events

* [X] error on mouseWheel() function.

## Documentation

* [ ] Build website and reference
  * [X] landing page
  * [x] download
  * [ ] reference index and pages
  * [ ] tutorials
  * [ ] examples pages
  * [ ] about

## Integration into Processing IDE

* [ ] add new L5 mode to Processing IDE

## Libraries

* [ ] camera
* [ ] sound
