# TODO

## Environment

* [X] fullscreen seems currently broken. called inside L5 at wrong time or related to setup events drawing call rewrite?
* [ ] error detection with useful error messages
* [X] fix flickering on event handling - graphics in mousePressed(), keyTyped(), keyReleased() double draw call and cause flickering i think
* [X] debug mouseClicked - probably needs to be added to draw after mousePressed
* [X] move all non-user-editable globals and constants to be keys in a single global env table (to prevent collisions with user-defined variables)
* [ ] check transforms reset at correct time? see the rotating square example.

## Color

* [X] line should be stroke color
* [X] html color names
* [X] Hex code colors
* [ ] add [HSB](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/HSV_color) and [HSL](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/HSL_color)
  * [X] add ability to set max value per val in table (RGBA, HSLA, HSBA)
* [ ] using html color name should assume RGB mode despite actual global L5_env.color_mode (or other way to handle this since stored as RGB value tables, values max 255)
* [X] colorMode should also allow setting individual max values for RGBA (or HSL/HSB) etc
* [X] fix: noFill seems to turn off all fill going forward, overriding fill()
* [ ] tint didn't seem to work when specified as 2-values: grayness,alpha

## Shapes

* [ ] test and fix arc to be consistent with p5 arc
* [ ] ellipseMode doesn't seem to work?

## Events
