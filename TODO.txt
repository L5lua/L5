# TODO

## Style
* [ ] Add linter 

## Debugging

* [X] pre-alpha tests on Mac
 * [X] correct shader differences between OSes
* [X] Test on Windows 

## Environment

* [ ] error detection with useful error messages
* [X] fullscreen seems currently broken. called inside L5 at wrong time or related to setup events drawing call rewrite?
* [X] fix flickering on event handling - graphics in mousePressed(), keyTyped(), keyReleased() double draw call and cause flickering i think
* [X] debug mouseClicked - probably needs to be added to draw after mousePressed
* [X] move all non-user-editable globals and constants to be keys in a single global env table (to prevent collisions with user-defined variables)
* [X] check transforms reset at correct time? see the rotating square example.
* [X] only call setup code once
  * [ ] in fact - fix so that you don't need a setup. the environment L5_env should be setup before - update: would be difficult to implement this to match Processing parity, requiring capturing and playing back commands.
  * [X] i think don't run it in love.load, only need to grab screensize from size() function out of it?
* [x] make setup() optional so that defaults/constants are set even without a setup (L5_env, size, etc)
  * [X] width not set if fullscreen in use or no size()
* [X] review noise() - how important is it that L5 does not implement Value Noise, which both Processing and p5.js use? (they may move to Simplex or Perlin so maybe this is not an issue!) - update: staying with Simplex currently
* [X] loop() doesn't seem to turn on looping again if currently stopped due to noLoop()
* [ ] save() function ignores specified filename argument to save the file under
* [X] add createGraphics() drawing to offscreen buffer
* [ ] Enhancement: figure out some way to allow passing in image vars instead of only image filepath for custom cursors 
* [ ] not registering backspace/delete key pressed

## Color

* [X] color_max isn't correctly taken into account
* [X] set default fill color (black?)
* [X] line should be stroke color
* [X] html color names
* [X] Hex code colors
* [X] add [HSB](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/HSV_color) and [HSL](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/HSL_color)
  * [X] add ability to set max value per val in table (RGBA, HSLA, HSBA)
* [ ] using html color name should assume RGB mode despite actual global L5_env.color_mode (or other way to handle this since stored as RGB value tables, values max 255)
* [X] colorMode should also allow setting individual max values for RGBA (or HSL/HSB) etc
* [X] fix: noFill seems to turn off all fill going forward, overriding fill()
* [X] tint should work when specified as 2-values: grayness,alpha
* [X] flickering happens in specific circumstances that need to be debugged such as transparency-related 
* [X] fix toColor() for individual args and table 
* [ ] test / fix ability to switch between filters
* [ ] noSmooth() does not appear to work well? test more and improve

## Shapes

* [X] test and fix arc to be consistent with p5 arc
* [X] ellipseMode doesn't seem to work? 
* [ ] imageMode(): add CORNERS mode
* [X] add custom shape creation via createShape() (processing) / beginShape() (p5.js), vertex() and endShape() (using love2d polygon - pass vertices as table?)
* [ ] improve beginShape to get feature parity with p5-processing with `kind`? at the very least, basic shape drawing should match basic examples on reference page.

## Filter

* [X] Improve blur algorithm - exponential blur, not Gaussian blur
* [ ] review optional params for consistency with processing/p5
* [ ] filter doesn't currently apply to setup, only in draw
* [ ] filter doesn't work correctly in draw if noLoop() is used

## Typography

* [X] font size (via L5_env.currentFontSize) does not seem to carry over from setup() to draw()
* [X] specifying optional width to text() function doesn't work correctly if textAlign() is set to CENTER or RIGHT currently. text doesn't draw to screen correctly.
* [ ] add utf-8 support to handle multi-byte UTF-8 characters (Chinese, emoji, etc.) correctly in CHAR wrap mode in text()

## Pixels

* [X] add pixel array and functions for working with pixels
* [ ] fix blend modes, currently not differentiated much, likely requires implementing shaders

## Events

* [X] error on mouseWheel() function.

## Platform

* [ ] add new L5 mode to Processing IDE
* [ ] custom launcher for L5 programs?
  * [ ] [VSCode launcher fork that packages L5?](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Menerv.love2d-launcher)
* [ ] VSCode extension for L5
  * [ ] VSCode setup instructions/starter
* [ ] Exporter
  * [ ] Wrapper to simplify export to Mac Application, PC executable or Linux appImage (compare to Processing's Export Application, basic GUI) - examples: [love-export](https://github.com/dmoa/love-export) (CLI, older), [love-build](https://github.com/ellraiser/love-build) (GUI built in Love, current)
