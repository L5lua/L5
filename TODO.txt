# TODO

## Shapes

* [ ] error detection with useful error messages
* [ ] test and fix arc to be consistent with p5 arc
* [X] line should be stroke color
* [X] fix flickering on event handling - graphics in mousePressed(), keyTyped(), keyReleased() double draw call and cause flickering i think
* [X] html color names
* [X] Hex code colors
* [ ] debug mouseClicked - probably needs to be added to draw after mousePressed
* [ ] add [HSB](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/HSV_color) and [HSL](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/HSL_color)
* [X] move all non-user-editable globals and constants to be keys in a single global env table (to prevent collisions with user-defined variables)
