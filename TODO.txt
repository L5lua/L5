# TODO

## Debugging

* [ ] Test on Mac
 * [ ] what do do about shader inconsistencies between platforms? possibly separate into separately called files depending on machine architecture. alternatively, maybe there is a way to rewrite globally?
* [X] Test on Windows 

## Environment

* [X] fullscreen seems currently broken. called inside L5 at wrong time or related to setup events drawing call rewrite?
* [ ] error detection with useful error messages
* [X] fix flickering on event handling - graphics in mousePressed(), keyTyped(), keyReleased() double draw call and cause flickering i think
* [X] debug mouseClicked - probably needs to be added to draw after mousePressed
* [X] move all non-user-editable globals and constants to be keys in a single global env table (to prevent collisions with user-defined variables)
* [X] check transforms reset at correct time? see the rotating square example.
* [ ] only call setup code once
* [ ] make setup() optional so that defaults/constants are set even without a setup (L5_env, size, etc)

## Color

* [X] line should be stroke color
* [X] html color names
* [X] Hex code colors
* [ ] add [HSB](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/HSV_color) and [HSL](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/HSL_color)
  * [X] add ability to set max value per val in table (RGBA, HSLA, HSBA)
* [ ] using html color name should assume RGB mode despite actual global L5_env.color_mode (or other way to handle this since stored as RGB value tables, values max 255)
* [X] colorMode should also allow setting individual max values for RGBA (or HSL/HSB) etc
* [X] fix: noFill seems to turn off all fill going forward, overriding fill()
* [ ] tint didn't seem to work when specified as 2-values: grayness,alpha
* [ ] test / fix ability to switch between filters
* [ ] noSmooth() does not appear to work well? test more and improve

## Shapes

* [X] test and fix arc to be consistent with p5 arc
* [X] ellipseMode doesn't seem to work? 

## Filter

* [ ] Improve blur algorithm
* [ ] review optional params for consistency with processing/p5
* [ ] filter doesn't currently apply to setup, only in draw

## Typography

* [X] font size (via L5_env.currentFontSize) does not seem to carry over from setup() to draw()

## Events

* [X] error on mouseWheel() function.

## Platform

* [ ] add new L5 mode to Processing IDE
* [ ] custom launcher for L5 programs?
  * [ ] [VSCode launcher fork that packages L5?](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Menerv.love2d-launcher)
* [ ] VSCode extension for L5
  * [ ] VSCode setup instructions/starter
* [ ] Exporter
  * [ ] Wrapper to simplify export to Mac Application, PC executable or Linux appImage (compare to Processing's Export Application, basic GUI) - examples: [love-export](https://github.com/dmoa/love-export) (CLI, older), [love-build](https://github.com/ellraiser/love-build) (GUI built in Love, current)
  * [ ] web export using love.js?

## Documentation

* [ ] Build website and reference
  * [X] landing page
  * [x] download
  * [ ] reference index and pages
  * [ ] tutorials
  * [ ] examples pages
  * [X] about

## Libraries

* [ ] camera
* [ ] sound
